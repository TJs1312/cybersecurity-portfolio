# Compliance checklist

- [x] **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

**Explanation:  Boltium Toys is working online with E.U citizens, so they have to adhere to the GDPR as they conduct business and collect personal information from people of the E.U.**

- [x] **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

**Explanation: As the online presence is the reason of this security audit, we could be one hundred percent sure that the online payment by card is being used (they store, accept, process and transmit credit card information)**
      
- [x] **System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)**

The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization’s user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

**Explanation: Botium Toys needs to establish and enforce appropriate user access for internal and external (third-party vendor) personnel to mitigate risk and ensure data safety.**
