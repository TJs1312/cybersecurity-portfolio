# OverTheWire Bandit lvl 12 to 13

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

This is a really simple script created to automate this excercise just after converting the hexdump to the origin file.
